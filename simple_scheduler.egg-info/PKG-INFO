Description: # simple_scheduler
        - Does not miss future events.
        - Uses multiprocessing to schedule jobs.
        - This package uses a 24-hour clock, only.
        - Simultaneously schedule any number of jobs.
        - Recurring jobs to be precisely sheduled.
        - Event jobs to be executed within the minute.
        - Long jobs to be executed even if previous call(s) is(are) still running.
        
        ## Install
        From [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/simple_scheduler/) :
        
            pip install simple-scheduler
        
        ## How to use?
        
        ### Quick-start
            See [examples](https://github.com/Vernal-Inertia/simple_scheduler/tree/main/examples/)
        
        ### Long
        There are two different schedulers:
        
            >>> from simple_scheduler.event import event_scheduler    
            >>> from simple_scheduler.recurring import recurring_scheduler
        
        Purpose of each scheduler:
        
            >>> print(event_scheduler.__doc__)
             Event occurs at an exact time.
                e.g. scirpt_1 is called at 14:00 and 20:00
                Each event is tried 3-times (but executed only once).
        
            >>> print(recurring_scheduler.__doc__)
             Recurring tasks are those that occur after every "x"-seconds.
                (e.g. script_1 is called every 600 seconds)
        
        #### Using only recurrent_scheduler
        
            >>> print(recurring_scheduler.add_job.__doc__)
        
                Assigns an periodic task to a process.
        
                Parameters
                ----------
                target : a callable function
                period_in_seconds : int
                    the time period in seconds to execute this function
                args : tuple(object,), optional
                    un-named argumets for the "target" callable
                    the default is ()
                job_name : str, optional
                    used to identify a job, defaults to name of the function
                    to remove jobs use this name            
                kwargs : dict{key:object}, optional
                    named argumets for the "target" callable
                    the default is {}
                number_of_reattempts : int, optional
                    default is 0
                    each recurring is tried these many number of times, but executed once
                reattempt_duration_in_seconds : int, optional
                    default is 10 secs
                    duration to wait (in seconds) after un-successful attempt
        
                Returns
                -------
                None.

        ### Toggle verbose (for debugging set to True)
            >>> event_scheduler.verbose = False
            >>> recurring_scheduler.verbose = True
        
        ### Job summary (before and after jobs are run)
            >>> event_scheduler.job_summary()

        ### Number of reattempts in case event fails [fallback]
            >>> event_scheduler.add_job(number_of_reattempts = 3)
            >>> recurring_scheduler.add_job(number_of_reattempts = 0)
        
        ### Reattempt duration(in seconds) between each reattempt [fallback]
            >>> event_scheduler.add_job(reattempt_duration_in_seconds = 10)
            >>> recurring_scheduler.add_job(reattempt_duration_in_seconds = 10)
        
        ### Remove a single job
            >>> event_scheduler.remove_job(job_name)
            >>> recurring_scheduler.remove_job(job_name)
            
        ### Clear schedule (remove all jobs)
            >>> event_scheduler.clear()
